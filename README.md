# LaTeX - Letter Template
## What is this?
This repository contains templates for the creation of files and documents with the LaTeX typesetting system. You will need a fully working TeX system on your computer to make use of them. TeX Live (http://www.tug.org/texlive/) and MacTeX (http://www.tug.org/mactex/) are widespread, but ot hte only distributions.
If you have no idea at all what this is about check out the wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX). If you do, you probably know where to look.
